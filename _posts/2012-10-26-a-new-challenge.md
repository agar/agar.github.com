A little while back I took part in the [Unmatched Stye CSSOff](http://www.unmatchedstyle.com/cssoff/) along with a couple of the front end developers from work. I managed an unexpected 2nd place, pipped at the post by a couple of points.

I found the process of competeing an entry to be a great motivator for pushing myself beyond what I do as part of everyday work, something I've always found difficult to do on my lonesome. So when [Github Game Off](https://github.com/blog/1303-github-game-off) was announched last week I thought it might prove another chance to push myself further and learn something new (and hopefully win a new iPad).

So here's the plan. I'm going to build a web based game, something that will push my knowledge of JavaScript and the various HTML api's - possibly making use of Websockets and Nodejs.

Oh, and I'l blog my progress too, get in the habit of sharing and all that...
