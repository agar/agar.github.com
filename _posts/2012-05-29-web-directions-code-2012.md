<p class="meta">29 May 2012 - Melbourne</p>

Last week I attended [Web Directions Code 2012](http://code12melb.webdirections.org/) with some of 
the other developers from work.

It was a great event (props to [John](https://twitter.com/johnallsopp), 
[Maxine](https://twitter.com/maxine) and everyone else involved), which provided loads of inspiration
 and awesome examples of cutting edge HTML/JavaScript. These included live demos of touch events, 
 WebSockets, Node/NPM, and the Medi­aStream/Peer­Con­nec­tion APIs for video conferencing to name but a 
 few.

However one of the things that struck me most, and one of the main reasons for attending, was the 
enthusiasm and excitement some of the presenters shared with their audience. This struck me 
particularly when listening to [Tammy Butow](http://twitter.com/tammybutow) speak about 
[HTML5 Forms](http://www.slideshare.net/tammybutow/html5-fantastic-forms-for-mobile-web). 
The topic itself was nothing new to me, but Tammy's excitement about the topic was contagious. 

Tammy's final slide challenging everyone to create, share and above all have fun has stuck with me. 
It's prompted me to start sharing things I learn.

Watch this space!
