<p class="meta">29 May 2012 - Melbourne</p>

Last week I attended [Web Directions Code 2012](http://code12melb.webdirections.org/) with some of 
the other developers from August. It was a great event (props to 
[John](https://twitter.com/johnallsopp), [Maxine](https://twitter.com/maxine) and everyone else 
involved),  which provided loads of inspiration and awesome examples of the power of HTML and 
JavaScript.

One of the things that struck me, and one of the main reasons for attending, was the enthusiasm 
and excitement about the web which the presenters shared with their audience. This struck me 
particularly when listening to [Tammy Butow](http://twitter.com/tammybutow) speak about 
[HTML5 Forms](http://www.slideshare.net/tammybutow/html5-fantastic-forms-for-mobile-web). 
The topic itself was nothing new to me, but Tammy's excitement about the topic was contagious. 

Tammy's final slide challenging everyone to create, share and above all have fun struck a chord 
with me. 

It's prompted me to start sharing things I learn.

Watch this space!
